### What is this repository all about? 
I have created this repository as apart of my ongoing studies within Data Analytics.
</br>
The aim of this repository is to demonstrate my understanding and knowledge of simulating and reviewing a dataset.
</br>
It is my intention to research and produce outputs to fully explain and show my workings in this repository.
</br>
This repository will contain a combination of: </br>
<ul>
  <li>Text</li>
  <li>Code</li>
  <li>Images</li>
  <li>Graphs</li>
</ul>

</br>

<h3> How to run a Jupyter Notebook </h3>
In order to run Jupyter Notebook on a machine, you need the programming language Python to be pre-installed. <br>

<p><strong><i>"While Jupyter runs code in many programming languages, Python is a requirement (Python 3.3 or greater, or Python 2.7) for installing the Jupyter Notebook itself."</i></strong></p>
<br>
I previously installed the Anaconda package on my computer which includes the Python language. Once I ensured I was on the latest software version of this, I was able to run Jupyter without difficulties.<br>
If you wish to install the Anaconda package aswell, here is the link: https://www.anaconda.com/download
<br><br>
The Jupyter Notebook is started from within the Command Prompt or Terminal of a computer. The user enters the command 'jupyter notebook' and presses 'Enter' on their keyboard. After a few moments, the Jupyter Notebook will launch within a browser window. <br><br>
The machine which you are using will determine the type of command window you use. <br>
Some examples include: 
<ul>
  <li>Command Prompt</li>
  <li>Terminal</li>
  <li>Cmder</li>
</ul>

While using the Juypter Notebook, the Command window remains open in the background creating backups of your content from Jupyter. It is best practice to close all Jupyter Notebook tabs <strong>before</strong> interacting with the Command window. </br>
In order to successfully end Jupyter press Ctrl C while in the Command window and this will fully shut down Jupyter.
