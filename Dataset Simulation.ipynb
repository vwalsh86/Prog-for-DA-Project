    "## Introduction\n",
    "This repository has been created as apart of my coursework in Data Analytics. The subject of this repository is a study on Box Plots. \n",
    "It is my intention to use this repository to investigate all aspects of the Box Plot using the available functions within Jupyter. \n",
    "The Box Plot is a popular and simple way of representing statistical data.\n",

    "## Aim of Investigation\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Choose a real-world phenomenon that can be measured and for which you could at least one-hundred data points across at least four different variables.\n",
    "2. Investigate the types of variables involved, their likely distributions, and their relationships with each other.\n",
    "3. Synthesise / simulate a data set as closely matching their properties as possible.\n",
    "4. Detail your research and implement the simulation in a Jupyter notebook - the data set itself can simply be displayed in an output cell within the notebook.\n",
