    "## Introduction\n",
    "This repository has been created as apart of my coursework in Data Analytics. The subject of this repository is a study on Data Sets and the simulation and investigation of such. \n",
    "It is my intention to use this repository to investigate all aspects of Data Set simulation using the available functions within Jupyter. \n",

    "## Statement of Work\n",
    "This is a statement to confirm that the work submitted within this repository is my own work. Any information sourced online or 3rd party has been referenced appropriately. I can therefore confirm that my submitted work is in line with the Quality Assurance Framework of GMIT.\n",

    "## Aim of Investigation\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Choose a real-world phenomenon that can be measured and for which you could at least one-hundred data points across at least four different variables.\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "2. Investigate the types of variables involved, their likely distributions, and their relationships with each other.\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "3. Synthesise / simulate a data set as closely matching their properties as possible.\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "4. Detail your research and implement the simulation in a Jupyter notebook - the data set itself can simply be displayed in an output cell within the notebook.\n",
    "------------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "## Investigation\n",
    "For my project I have chosen to base my dataset on the real-world problem of poor attendance within a call-centre enviorment. Particuarly the variable I am most interested in is the high level of absense rates. <br> \n",
    "I have 11 years of experience working within the call-centre industry and during my time I have worked in various sectors and various companies. Within each role there has been a continuous issue with a constantly high-level of absenses. There are various factors (variables) that can play a role in this taking place. \n",
