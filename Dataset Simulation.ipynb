    "This repository has been created as apart of my coursework in Data Analytics. The subject of this repository is a study on Data Sets and the simulation and investigation of such. \n",
    "It is my intention to use this repository to investigate all aspects of Data Set simulation using the available functions within Jupyter. \n",

    "\n",
    "1. Choose a real-world phenomenon that can be measured and for which you could at least one-hundred data points across at least four different variables.\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "2. Investigate the types of variables involved, their likely distributions, and their relationships with each other.\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "3. Synthesise / simulate a data set as closely matching their properties as possible.\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "4. Detail your research and implement the simulation in a Jupyter notebook - the data set itself can simply be displayed in an output cell within the notebook.\n",

    "## Investigation\n",
    "For my project I have chosen to base my dataset on the real-world problem of employee attendance in call-centre employment.<br> \n",
    "I have 11 years experience working within the call-centre industry and during my time I have worked in various sectors and various companies. I have worked directly for a company and also third-party as a vendor. Within each employment there has been a continuous trend of high absence rates.<br> There are various factors (variables) that can play a role in this taking place. \n",
    "<br>\n",
    "There are numerous factors that could play a role in this issue including (but not limited to); <br>\n",
    "<li>Knowledge / training issues</li>\n",
    "<li>Management style</li>\n",
    "<li>High staff turnover</li>\n",
    "<li>Loyalty to the business</li>\n",
    "<li>Full-time / Part-time</li>\n",
    "<li>Low morale</li>\n",
    "<li>Disengagement</li>\n",
    "<li>General illness</li>\n",
    "<li>Stress</li>\n",
    "<li>Work experience</li>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "The variables that I am going to work with are:\n",
    "<ul>\n",
    "    <li>Number of absences <i>(attendance)</i></li>\n",
    "    <li>Full or part time <i>(hours)</i></li>\n",
    "    <li>Performance <i>(rank)</i></li>\n",
    "    <li>Loyalty to the business <i>(loyal)</i></li>\n",
    "</ul>\n",
    "\n",
    "The variable I am most interested in with this investigation is the absense rate of employees <i>(attendance)</i>.\n",
    "\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "When I decided to research some information to back this theory my first Google search was \"call centre attendance\". The first numerous hits were lists of solutions and guides on how to tackle and reduce attendance issues, proving my choice for this dataset valid.\n",

    "\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "Upon researching it looks like the majority of call centre population is made up of full-time hires. There is a certain stigma that part-time employees contribute less or have a lesser  need for support in the workplace. It also seems to be less popular to hire call centre staff on a part-time basis. <br>\n",
